Stats Canada - Mental Health and Well-being App
========================

This Shiny App uses data from Statistics Canada on Mental Healh and Well-being. You can find the app on [ShinyApps.io](https://kurtis14.shinyapps.io/stats-can_mood-disorders/).

This is definitely a work-in-progress. There are still a few issues to deal with, such as:

  * Regions with missing values
  * Poor names of variables
  * Probably should be using proportions rather than number of people, that would be more informative
  * Dealing with the poor facetting of the plots
  * Altering the order of the regions in the plots
  
However, the purpose of this app was to add to our [gapminder app](https://kurtis14.shinyapps.io/Gapminder-app/) as part of [homework 11](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/hw11_build-shiny-app).

I think that I accomplished this by using the tab, downloading data, and multiple inputs features.
